# 3D Potential Distribution and EM wave Propagation Simulation
<br>

This project is made for simulating the EM-field.<br><br>

1. [Projectfinal.pdf](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/1/Projectfinal.pdf) 
<br>it is a comprehensive report addressing to every detail regarding to the project.
<br><br>

2. [Project_distribution.m](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/1/project_distribution.m)
<br>It is the first part of this project, simulating the potential field in a 3D cube. 
<br><br>
3. [Numerical_EM_wave.m](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/1/numerical_EM_wave.m)
<br>It is the second part, simulating the papagation of the EM wave. The finite-difference simulating results are provided.
<br><br>
4. [Analytical_EM_wave.m](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/1/analytical_EM_wave.m) 
<br>It provides the correct result as reference to 3.
