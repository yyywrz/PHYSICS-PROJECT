# 3D Potential Distribution and EM wave Propagation Simulation
<br>

This project is made for simulating the EM-field.

the projectfinal.pdf(https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/raw/master/1/projectfinal.pdf) is a comprehensive report addressing to every detail regarding to the project.

The project has two parts. 

The first part simulates the potential field in a 3D cube. It acheves by project_distribution.m(https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/raw/master/1/README.md)

The second part simulates the papagation of the EM wave. The analytical_EM_wave.m(https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/raw/master/1/analytical_EM_wave.m) provides the correct result as reference, and numerical_EM_wave.m(https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/raw/master/1/numerical_EM_wave.m) gives the finite-difference simulating results.
