#3D Potential Distribution and EM wave Propagation Simulation

This project is made for simulating the EM-field.

the projectfinal.pdf is a comprehensive report addressing to every detail regarding to the project.

the project has two parts. 

The first part simulates the potential field in a 3D cube. It acheves by project_distribution.m

The second part simulates the papagation of the EM wave. The analytical_EM_wave.m provides the correct result as reference, and numerical_EM_wave.m gives the finite-difference simulating results.
