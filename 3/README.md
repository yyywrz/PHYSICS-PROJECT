# Solving a 2-dimensional Laplacian Equation by Symmetric Matrix
<br><br>
The easier way to approach the solution is Central-difference Method, which is used in the first part of project-1.<br>
In this project, I tried an alternative approach to estimate the distribution.

A comprehensive report is provided.<br><br>
2.[Laplacian.m](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/3/Laplacian2d.m)<br>
This code is just for caculating the basic case in the report.<br>
The cases mentioned in report's further discussion can be easily achieved by adjusting the boudary conditions.
