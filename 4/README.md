# Finding the Stable State by Upwind Method
<br><br>Upwind Method is designed to solve hyperbolic partial differential equation, which usually contains both dimensional components and time component.<br>
For this project, I used two methods, which are Euler and Rung-kutta, to approach the final state.

1.[Report](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/4/upwind.pdf)
<br>It gives the background information, upwind scheme, time-evolutional scheme, and results.
<br><br>
2.[Euler.m](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/4/upwindEuler.m)<br>
It provides the solution with Euler Method.
<br><br>
3.[Runge-Kutta.m](https://github.com/yyywrz/PHYSICS-PROJECT/blob/master/4/upwindRK.m)<br>
It provides the solution with Runge-Kutta Method
