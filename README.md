# PHYSICS-PROJECT
Some projects I have done when I was a physics student
All projects presented here are related to physics.
The written reports are more important than the codes, because coding for engineering use just work as a caculation.
Some of them are interesting.


1. Three-Dimensional Potential Distribution and Electromagnetic Wave Propagation Simulation
